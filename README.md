# `primesieve` for Dart

This is a wrapper for [Kim Walisch's `primesieve` C/C++
library](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve).
It requires the library to already be installed.
The library is only available for some platforms, please check
availability.

## Looking for a simpler/pure Dart alternative?

If you only need primes up to about 1E9 or prefer to have a Dart-only
implementation, you may want to try
[Prime-Sieve-Dart](https://github.com/MarcelWaldvogel/Prime-Sieve-Dart)
instead, which can be installed with `pub` as `prime-sieve` (note the
dash).

Please note that the pure Dart alternative is significantly slower and
lacks many features.
